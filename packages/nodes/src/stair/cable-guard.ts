/**
 * One coherent cable guard laid out along a rail path, as oriented boxes — the
 * modern metal cable rail in metres: a slim square post at each end (and every
 * bay ≤ 4 ft between), a flat cap rail following the path over them, and
 * slender round cables run as straight spans from post to post, with a short
 * swage sleeve where each cable dies into a terminal post. It shares the path
 * sampling, corner finding and newel/picket stations in `guard-path.ts` with
 * the baluster and deck post-and-rail guards, so a straight flight, a chained
 * L/U landing turn, a winder, a curved or spiral sweep and an integrated top
 * landing all read as the same cable rail; only the sections and the infill
 * differ. Pure data — no Three.js, no React.
 *
 * The cables are the physical intent of a cable rail, not a fiction: real cable
 * is pulled taut, so on a curved or spiral sweep it cannot follow the arc. Each
 * cable level is therefore a run of straight chords between consecutive posts
 * (the posts are the support stations, spaced by run and so independent of the
 * tread count), while the cap rail follows the curve. On a straight flight the
 * collinear posts make those chords read as one line.
 *
 * `reach` runs the cap and the top cables that far past the top vertex along
 * the final slope to die into a post standing there; `topPost: false` then
 * omits the top post. `postThrough` runs the posts past the cap with a small
 * cap of their own.
