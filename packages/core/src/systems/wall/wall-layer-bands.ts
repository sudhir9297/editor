 * Slices a wall's mitred plan footprint into the bands of an assembly's layers

 *
 * The stack sets the body, so the bands tile exactly the footprint that
 * mitering, rooms and 2D already use once `thickness` holds the layer sum. A
 * wall whose stored thickness disagrees gets the `assembly.thickness-mismatch`
 * diagnostic and no bands: it keeps its plain body until a writer re-derives
 * the thickness. Layers stack from the front face (+n), or from the exterior
 * face with `face: 'exterior'` (`resolveWallExteriorSide`, back as fallback).
 *
 * Straight walls intersect the footprint with half-plane strips through the
 * core polygon booleans, which handles the junction vertex a mitred end cap
 * may carry. A curved footprint's end caps are single segments, so its bands
 * resample the footprint's own arcs at the band offsets and interpolate along
 * each cap.
