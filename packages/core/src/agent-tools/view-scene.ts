    "Look at the building in 3D from a viewpoint you pick and get the picture back. Use it to compare what you built with a reference and say what differs before you fix it: the facade from the photo's own camera (camera: its position, aim, field of view and aspect), rendered at the photo's aspect to lay beside it; or from the photo's side at street height (from, eyeHeight 1.7); one face square on (projection orthographic); the massing from above. North is the plan's top edge (z grows south, x east). The view frames the target (a building, a level, a wall or a zone; the whole building by default) from outside, unless you place the eye yourself with position or camera. A door, a window or an item on a floor frames at detail scale, an opening seen from its outside face: a close-up to lay beside the photo's crop of the same element, to see what differs. Over the MCP the user's editor tab open on the project renders the picture: with none open it is refused (editor_tab_required), and a tab in the background must be brought to the front (editor_tab_hidden). A picture is not a measure: take sizes and counts from the tools.",
