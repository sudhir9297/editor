const DESCRIPTION = `Build an object by writing a plain three.js module, the way you would in any three.js project. Use it for what the catalog and the structure tools cannot reproduce faithfully: custom columns and capitals, mouldings and trim, panels, lanterns and fixtures, exposed beams, vaulted or tray ceiling bodies, canopies, a porch, railings, built-ins. Pascal runs the module in a sandbox, stores the result and places it as one object the user can move, paint, and ask you to edit again.

Module shape (import THREE from the three package as usual; the addons below too):
  // also available: three/addons/utils/BufferGeometryUtils.js, three/addons/geometries/{RoundedBoxGeometry,ConvexGeometry,LoftGeometry,ParametricGeometry}.js, three-bvh-csg (Brush, Evaluator, SUBTRACTION, ADDITION, INTERSECTION)
  export const params = { width: { default: 4.8, min: 3, max: 8, step: 0.1, unit: 'm', label: 'Width' } }
  export const mount = 'floor'   // 'floor' | 'wall-side' (on a wall face) | 'wall' (through a wall, like a window) | 'ceiling'
  export default function build({ params, THREE }) { const group = new THREE.Group(); /* … */ return group }

One object is one feature that changes together: a porch, a railing run, a fireplace surround, a ceiling with its beams. Never a whole house, and never walls, rooms, floors, roofs, stairs, doors or windows: those have their own tools. A new object says what it stands in for (reason): the scene check lists every authored object with its reason, so each names something Pascal has no type for. On a floor, a plain box with a wall's size or a floor plate is refused with the tool to use (use_walls, use_slab); a detailed object with a wall's size (a bookcase, a screen), or one named after something Pascal builds, is built with a hint naming the tool.

Conventions (they make the object work in Pascal; follow them):
- Metres, Y up, modelled as it stands. Pascal puts the bottom-centre of the bounds at the placement point; for wall-side the back face sits on the wall and the object faces +Z.
- Paint: name every material slot_<finish> (slot_trim, slot_frame, slot_metal) and reuse one material per finish; a material named "glass" renders as glass.
- Parts: name the few groups a person would point at part:<id> (part:column_left, part:canopy, part:landing), usually 2–24, a group per part, not every mesh. Set userData.type on parts someone would look for: column, beam, slab, roof, railing, panel, trim, step, light.
- Lights: add a THREE.PointLight or SpotLight named light:<id> where the bulb is; it becomes a switchable light.
- Motion: put THREE.AnimationClips on the returned group's .animations, as in any three.js project; tracks target <objectName>.<property> or <object.uuid>.<property> and may use any transform property (position, rotation, rotation[y], quaternion, scale); material and visibility tracks do not animate. A clip named open becomes the object's open/close control (close plays a clip named close, or open reversed); a clip named loop runs continuously; every other clip gets its own play toggle labelled with its name (name it for the person: "Twirl", "Music"). Write as many clips as the object needs.
- Cuts: a mesh named cutout cuts only the mounted host; cut:wall, cut:ceiling and cut:slab require that host kind (floor items cut their support slab). The hidden cutter must reach the host; walls use its real shape, ceilings and slabs its through-hole footprint.
- Sockets: an empty Object3D named anchor:<id> marks where other things attach.
- No textures, network or DOM. At most 300k triangles, 32 materials, 60 m per side.

Edit: pass nodeId with new code and/or params (params alone rebuild the stored script; read it first with get_source to change the code); identity, placement, paint and the params you leave out are kept. The result lists the size, parts, slots, lights, animations and params.`
